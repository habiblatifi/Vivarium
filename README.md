#  Vivarium Framework - CMV ODE System

This repository contains the initial implementation of the **Predator-Prey dynamic system** using the **Vivarium framework**, as a starting point toward the ultimate goal of developing and simulating the **CMV ODE system**. The Predator-Prey system serves as a foundational example to demonstrate how Vivarium can model dynamic biological systems.

## Project Overview

This project begins with the **Predator-Prey system**, modeled using the Vivarium framework, to build familiarity with dynamic system modeling. The ultimate goal of this project is to implement a **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) ODE system**, which will simulate viral dynamics and immune interactions at multiple scales. The Predator-Prey model is an essential first step in validating the approach and understanding how Vivarium handles system topologies, time-series data, and modular process definitions.
